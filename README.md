# OpenMP-labs
A repository of parallel programming exercises using OpenMP API in C and C++ for hands-on learning.
These labs provide practical exercises to explore parallel programming concepts and techniques using the OpenMP API.

## About OpenMP

OpenMP (Open Multi-Processing) is an API that supports multi-platform shared-memory multiprocessing programming in C, C++ and Fortran. It allows developers to write parallel code that can run on multiple processors simultaneously.

## Instructions

### Compilation and Execution

To compile and execute the .c or .cpp files in this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/OpenMP-labs.git

2. **Navigate to the Repository Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd OpenMP-labs
   
3. **Compile the .c or .cpp Files:**:
   ```bash
   gcc -fopenmp -o <output_file_name> <input_file_name.c>
   g++ -fopenmp -o <output_file_name> <input_file_name.cpp>

4. **Execute the Compiled Program**:
   ```bash
   ./<compiled_executable>
